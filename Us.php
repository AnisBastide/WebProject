                <div class="txt_it">The Coding Factory by Itescia is a school in order to become a computer coder,
                    this training is done over 3 years and is possbile in alternation, reconversions are available in
                    order to refocus on the code. After the 3 years, it is possible to go in different ways, video games,
                    or project manager.
                    The school uses the SCRUM methodoligy, an agile method allowing to adapt to any project and to manage
                    changes of objectives at any time.
                    Each week being a different course on agile background, we learn from Monday to Wednesday a language
                    or a techno in order to put it into practice on Thursday in a group project in order to present it on Friday.
                    Friday afternoon is dedicated to the labday, a time of the week when each group works on projects that are important to them.
                    The courses are managed by Product Owners, independent developers who wish to share their knowledge with apprentices.
