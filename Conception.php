                The basic idea for this game was born during a lab'day. In our school,
                lab'day is a period in which groups of students work on projects
                that are important to them while being supported by the school,
                either financially or technically.</br></br> Our project is to create a
                metroidvania game in which there is no main character, there is
                just a story with various characters and the player can choose the
                character he wants to play via NFC-based miniatures to make it appear
                at any time in the game. Each miniature will have its own stats and
                upgradeable abilities depending on the character with the help of money
                and experience found while playing with it.This way, each player will
                be able to play the game as he wishes with a character he likes.

            <h1 class="conc_title">A rich and fantastic universe!</h1>
            <p>
                For this game, we decided to create a whole universe around it,
                so it includes a map, factions, relationships between factions
                and races, the characters also have all their own story and
                their relationship with each faction due to their respective
                past. If you want to learn more: <a href="./Characters.php#storypart">go here</a>.</br>
                The lore of the game was invented and written by: Nathan Goutet
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="conc_cara">
            <h2>Heroes for everyone!</h2>
            <p>
                The game is therefore not played with a single protagonist. The diversity
                of classes and races in the universe allows each player to find the character
                that suits them in terms of playability.</br> This great diversity allows each
                player to play this way or to play in a different way depending on the
                situation in front of him.</br> A boss with a lot of life in front of you?</br>
                Take a warrior or an assassin to play at a distance!</br> A wave of the enemy right in front of you?</br>
                Either take a Mage and play at a distance or take a paladin and run into
                the pile!</br>
                The characters also have their own affinities and characters!

                <h4>Warrior</h4>
                <p>Warriors heroes are globally balanced, they have a correct
                    resistance, powerful weapons, and normal speed. They
                    excel in hand-to-hand combat, but the way they fight
                    depends on the enemy in front of them.</p>

                <h4>Assassin</h4>
                <p>Assassins heroes have light armor they are not very
                    resistant but they are fast due to their equipment
                    and have light weapons, their objectives and not to stay
                    too long in contact with the enemy.</p>

                <h4>Paladin</h4>
                <p>Paladins heroes are more resistant with bigger armor,
                    they are slower, do a little less damage but can
                    survive easily on the battlefield.</p>

                <p>Mages heroes are peculiar, they are mainly played at a distance,
                    are fragile, are not very fast, but they can attack their enemies
                    with very powerful magic attacks. It depends on their abilities,
                    but mages are played mainly at a distance.</p>
